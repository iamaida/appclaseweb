# Collaborative Project: Basic Math Calculator

Welcome to our collaborative project to create a basic mathematical calculator! This project is part of our academy activity, aimed at practicing programming skills and version control teamwork.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will develop a simple calculator that can perform arithmetic operations such as pairs, fibonacci, and so on. The calculator has a basic interface that consists of a select, a text area, and a button.

## Getting Started

To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your development environment with the necessary tools (e.g., IDE, Git).
3. Review the existing codebase and project structure.
4. Choose an mathematic operation to do
5. Create a new branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
6. Implement the desired feature or fix.
7. Test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.
8. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`).
9. Push your changes to your forked repository (`git push origin feature-name`).
10. Open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main branch.
